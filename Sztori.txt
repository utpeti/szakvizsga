Introduction:
Once upon a time there was a well known adventurer, you. You lived in the strong Assyrian Empire along with your comrades whom you knew very well, and vice versa. The same goes for the walls, for every mouse hole, for every pub, for every hideout. Neither was the king an exception. He has entrusted you with a bunch of missions throughout the years which you completed without any problems. 
(Kastélyos háttér)

Intriga:
One day the emperor called you in. (elsötétül a háttér csak a betük látszanak)
Dialog I (palota belső része, a képernyő bal szélén a hős, jobb szélén a király):
Emperor: You are probably wondering why I invited you to my splendid palace! Unfortunately, my daughter has been kidnapped!
You: This is the fifth time this year...
Emperor: Therefore, I kindly please you to help her.
You: Where is she?
Empereror: Gossips say she is in the dangerous Magic Mine! So, do you accept the mission?

Elsötétül megint minden -> választani kell:  -Yes /  -No

	No (akasztófás kép): For you have denied the emperor's command you have been hanged

	Yes(útelágozós kép): Along your journey you came across an intersection.

	!You continue your route to the:
	-left
	-right
	
	left(hidas kép): You have met with your old friend Gibbon the goblin:
	GIBBON: So we meet again! You already know my conditions: either you pay or you die!
	YOU: If you weren't an endangered species I would have killed you 10 times already.
	GOBLIN: So what is your next move?
	
	(elsötétül minden)
	
		Don't pay and try to escape: He stabbed you 45 times with his butterknife and you died a horrible death.

		Pay(bányás kép)
	
	right(bányás kép)


	(Bányás kép): Now at the entrance of the mine you run into a miner.
	MINER: Halt! You shall not pass, unless you answer my question!
	YOU: I don't have any money on me, ask Gibbon.
	MINER: I don't care about your filthy money! My question is: what is the integral of (x-2)/sqrt(1-x^2)?
	- - sqrt(1 - x^2) - 2 * x * arcsin(x) + c
	- - sqrt(1 - x^2) - 2arcsin(x) + c
	- - sqrt(1 - x) - 2x*arcsin(x) + c
	
	
	(elsötétül minden)
	
		Nem a kozépső:
			MINER: WRONG! We do not let in here some idiot!
			(akasztófás kép) Since you couldn't complete the Emperors' task you have been hanged as a punishment.
		
	A középső:

(Bánya, teljesen sötét kép): You managed to enter a mine...good job! Everyone is proud of you. 
(Pick up a torch 'button'): You've got a torch too. You are getting better, champ!
(Kivilágosodik a kép): It seems to be a junction. You choose the path:
on the left
in the middle
on the right

left:
(megerkezik a kiralylanyahoz) -ezt egyutt kitalaljuk
After a prolonged walk you arrive to the mighty glorious noble wise Supreme Leader's daughter.

middle:
You've noticed a well hidden trap behind an enormous rock and you try to evite it. You die due to your asthma.

right:
(megerkezik a kiralylanyhoz) -ezt egyutt kitalaljuk
You've arrived easily to the Emperor's daughter. Luckily you've picked the best possible path.

Elsötétül - kivilágosodik)
Entering into the depths of the cave you notice the girl crying on a rock. You look around and find no monster, no burglar, no final boss which you could fight with. Nevertheless, you are precautious, and slowly approach her:

YOU: Excuse me Miss! There is no need to be devastated anymore! I came here for your rescue, just kindly tell me where is you kidnapper!
PRINCESS: If you came here to bring me back there, you can already get lost! There is no terrifying monster here, I came here on my own.
YOU: What about the miner?
PRINCESS: I payed him to defend me and let in only those people that have an IQ level above room temperature. You know, I need a company sometimes. But not with those jerk servant, they know nothing!

Anyway...why did you come here?
-The Emperor sent me --I should have known...
-I was just being around --Liar!
-Beacuse of the reward --Get out of here!

Why do you help for my father?
-For the reward --Get out of here!
-I know you since you have born, I had to help
-I have been given an order.

Please, leave me alone!
-You know I can't do that, Miss...It's my duty to return you to the Emperor. -- I order you to go!
-I beg you, you can't stay here forever, Miss! --I can do whatever I want.
-Without you? Never! -- ^-^

I don't want to go back to my father!
-You will come back, doesn't matter if you want to or not, Miss.
-You have to. Otherwise both of us will die.
-I have an offer for you
	If you come back with me:
	-I will marry you.
	-I will kill your wicked father.
	-I will talk to your father.
